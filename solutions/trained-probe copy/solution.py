"""Codabench entry point for the trained representation probe.

This is the *only* file the evaluator calls directly. It must expose:

* an ``are_robust(model_id, problems)`` function accepting problem strings and
  returning one bool per problem.

All heavy lifting (loading the probe artifact, running the model, scoring the
probes) lives in :mod:`probe_inference` so this file stays a thin adapter
between the Codabench contract and the implementation.
